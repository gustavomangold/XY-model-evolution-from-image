This is a quick project for a contest, all code is a little quirky and should not be taken as serious to use, it's just for fun.
The XY model is used to evolve an image of any size, but preferably of small one (as time complexity of the algorithm grows with pixels^2).
There is an option to add a cone vision to spins, based on a paper I previously reproduced using a code similar to this (https://github.com/gustavomangold/xy-model-cone-vision); the C implementation used there is much quicker 
and, altough no image support is available, it should be used for serious simulations.
